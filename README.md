# fast_photodetection
In fast varying dynamic event, sometimes optical diagnostics is preferred more than electromagnetic measurement because of inherent isolation, immunity to electromagnetic interference (EMI), conducted noise suppression etc. In many cases it is the only choice for measurement of fast varying parameter. 
Measurement of nanoseconds time scale event with isolation and free from EMI requires fast photo detectors capable of few nanoseconds rise-time, good linearity and accuracy. Rise-time is defined as the time taken to reach the output from 10% to 90% level of the maximum value. In order to achieve that, we have decided to design and develop fast photo-detector having less than 10 nanoseconds rise time, and linear with input light power. 
At first our objective is to study different aspect of photo detectors, dynamic event, importance of nanosecond response time detectors etc. Then we will do survey for different components required for designing fast photo detector as our aim is  to design and develop a fast photodetector module. And finally we test the response of the developed detector module for pulsed light, continuous light and also by varying intensity of light.
